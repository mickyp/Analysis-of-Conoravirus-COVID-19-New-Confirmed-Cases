## Project Description
Since the novel coronavirus (COVID-19 ) had spread all over the whole world, I want to find out how the new confirmed cases changed in the top 10 confirmed cases countries and my country, Taiwan. I use multiple linear regression to predict and fit between 11 countries, including China, Italy, Spain, Germany, Iran, the United States, France, South Korea, Switzerland, United Kindom, and Taiwan. Then I compare the trends of these countries and try to explain the differences and why the result comes out. The dataset I used collected confirmed, deaths, and recovered data from 179 countries from January 22, 2020, to March 18, 2020.
